// FEIP-8013: the ONE place a per-story experiment is merged into the feature
// branch + recorded as accepted. Both entry points route through here:
//   - `lakebase-sftdd-experiment merge` (explicit args; the recovery door), and
//   - `lakebase-sftdd-pipeline accept` (args resolved from the persisted
//     experiment record + scm-state; the normal PO-acceptance door).
//
// Before this, `pipeline accept` recorded ONLY the state (acceptStory) and the
// git-merge lived solely in the experiment CLI, invoked as the drive's accept
// EFFECT. Interactive, the acceptance gate stops BEFORE that effect and the human
// ran only `pipeline accept`, so the merge never fired and the accepted story's
// code stayed on the experiment branch (the next story then forked from a feature
// branch missing it). Making `pipeline accept` perform the merge, through this
// shared core, means following the gate's instruction lands the code.
