// Escalations: the single "raise to the HIL" channel (follow-up).
//
// WHY: a live smoke shipped a false-GREEN on a self-contradictory test, the
// orchestration stamped green without a real run, ignored the Navigator's
// contradiction smell, and then STALLED at await-acceptance. The fix is a
// uniform rule: after ANY role/step surfaces a blocking problem (a failed honest
// GREEN run, a blocking bad-smell, a deploy verify-fail), it writes an
// escalation here, and the deterministic driver routes to a single `raise-to-hil`
// halt while an unresolved escalation exists, it never advances past it and
// never silently spins. Headless mode surfaces + halts (a human resumes); it
// does not auto-decide.
