// FEIP-8023: driving a feature whose recorded SCM claim names a DIFFERENT
// feature (a prior feature shipped out-of-band, .lakebase/workflow-state.json
// never reconciled) must be refused loud , otherwise the drive derives the
// experiment's parent from the stale predecessor branch and commits build output
// onto the wrong branch.
//
// The DECISION is the pure `isForeignFeatureClaim` (behaviorally covered in
// scm-workflow-state.test.ts). This file guards the WIRING: that the feature
// drive path in drive.cli.ts consults it and refuses (returns 2) before running
// the driver. drive.cli.ts is a self-invoking bin that relies on the dist's
// __dirname shim, so it cannot be imported or run from source in-process; a
// static source assertion (the same approach as drive-bin-resolution.test.ts) is
// the proportionate wiring check without a full dist build.
