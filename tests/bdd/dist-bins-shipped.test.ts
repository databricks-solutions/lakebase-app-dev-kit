// Release-artifact guard: every bin in package.json must be SHIPPED, i.e. its
// dist/ target must be git-tracked. dist/ is .gitignore'd but the kit ships a
// pre-built dist on every tag (force-added despite the ignore) because a consumer
// install (npm install github:...#ref) skips the build , see scripts/prepare.mjs.
//
// The defect this guards: when a new bin family landed (the sftdd/tdd CLIs), its
// built output was gitignored and never force-added, so the shipped dist omitted
// dist/scripts/sftdd/** entirely. `npm run build` produced the files locally, so
// nothing on disk looked wrong, but a real consumer install was missing 48 of 75
// bins , every /plan, /design, /build, /deploy backend. A disk-existence check
// would NOT have caught it (the dev clone builds them); only a git-tracked check
// does. So this test asks git, not the filesystem.
