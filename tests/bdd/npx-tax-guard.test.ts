// Guard against the npx tax creeping back in. Kit CLIs invoked from a scaffolded
// project must go through the fast `./scripts/lk` resolver (node dist, ~0.09s),
// NOT `npx --package=github#ref <bin>` (~3.5s, re-resolves the ref every call).
//
// The smoke's create-project bootstrap also runs through the kit's OWN committed
// lk (templates/project/common/scripts/lk) so a run is DETERMINISTIC: lk resolves
// via `npm install <committish>` (content-addressed for a SHA, honors a pre-built
// $LAKEBASE_KIT_DIR), never the `npx pack` path that throws "GitFetcher requires
// an Arborist constructor" on a SHA committish, and never a moving ref's stale
// _cacache. One resolution path => identical bits on every step of every run.
//
// Two intentional exceptions keep npx: the kit's own create path (commands/tdd.md,
// a real user with no kit checkout, pinned to a published tag npx caches fine) and
// the project CI workflows (pinned to an immutable published version tag).
