// REACHABILITY GUARD for the closed agent-log event vocabulary.
//
// Why this exists: the suite was green at ~1900 tests while cycle.review and
// cycle.refactored reached the central log from NO code path (the per-AC
// review/refactor lane wrote review.json but emitted nothing; the only
// cycle.refactored producer, run-cycle.markRefactored, was the dead per-test
// path). Defining an event in the vocabulary + giving it a schema + a template
// does NOT make it emitted. Nothing connected "this event is in the vocabulary"
// to "some path actually produces it", so a deterministic event could be silent
// and every unit test stayed green.
//
// This guard closes that gap: EVERY event in the closed vocabulary must be
// explicitly classified, and its classification must hold on disk:
//   - CODE_EMITTED   : a deterministic substrate path emits it. Asserted: a
//                      TS `event: "<name>"` producer exists in scripts/ (outside
//                      the logging plumbing itself).
//   - AGENT_EMITTED  : a role emits it via the lakebase-tdd-log CLI as a JUDGMENT
//                      (smell/concern/open question/progress, or a role-observed
//                      verify/deploy/adherence outcome). Asserted: at least one
//                      agent doc instructs it. (Weaker than CODE_EMITTED: a role
//                      may forget. Events that SHOULD be deterministic belong in
//                      CODE_EMITTED, with the dynamic per-AC trail test in
//                      tdd-cycle-record proving the real path emits them.)
//   - KNOWN_DEAD     : in the vocabulary but produced by NOTHING (no code path,
//                      no agent instruction). A documented debt: each must be
//                      WIRED (move to CODE_EMITTED) or REMOVED from the
//                      vocabulary. This list may only SHRINK.
//
// The union of the three MUST equal the vocabulary, so a newly-added event fails
// the build until it is classified , forcing the author to say who emits it.
